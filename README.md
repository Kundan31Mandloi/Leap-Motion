# Leap-Motion
This project is the Combination of Hardware and Software using which we can access our Computer System from the distance with the help of Arduino and ultrasonic sensors.

**Required Python Libraries**
1) Serial
2) Speech_Recognition (Optional: Added to Enhance the Feature)
3) Pyautogui
4) Pyperclip
5) Pyttsx3
6) Win32com
7) Winsound

**Required Hardware**
1) Arduino
2) Ultrasonic Sensors - 2 qty

**Key Features**
1) We can access our system from a distance with the help of ultrasonic sensors
2) These instructions need to be followed:
   i) For Left click, put your hand on left Sensor between 10 to 25 centimeter
   ii) For Right click, put your hand on right Sensor between 10 to 25 centimeter 
   iii) For Left Move, put your hand on left Sensor between 25 to 60 centimeter 
   iv) For right Move, put your hand on right Sensor between 25 to 60 centimeter 
   v) For down Move, put your hands on both Sensors together between 10 to 25 centimeter 
   vi) For up Move, put your hands on both Sensors together between 25 to 60 centimeter 
   vii) For typing, keep your one hand on left sensor between 10 to 25 centimeter and other hand on right sensor together between 25 to 60 centimeter 
   viii) If you forget the rule than keep your hands on both the sensors, Rules will be repeated again
3) Code which needs to be written in Arduino is also attached
4) We can use the Same functionality, if we want to build **Blind Stick**
